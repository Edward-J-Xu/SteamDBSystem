('The Isle', '<strong>The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You</strong><br><br>The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. <br><br>There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It''s kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors.<strong>Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer</strong><br><br>Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you''ll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature.<br><br>Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise.<strong>Survival or Sandbox?</strong><br><br>The Isle''s core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. <br><br>However, sometimes you don''t want to struggle to survive, or you don''t have the time to go through a dinosaur''s whole life story. And that''s okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won''t judge.<strong>A Global Community Story</strong><br><br>The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? <br><br>It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game''s storyline.<strong>Future Development Goals</strong><br><br>We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include:<br><br><ul><li>Playable aquatic and aerial creatures<br></li><li>Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles<br></li><li>Two new playable factions: modern humans &amp; the indigenous<br></li><li>Evolve into advanced &quot;strain&quot; versions of certain dinosaurs<br></li><li>Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours<br></li><li>Additional world biome types such as thick jungles<br></li><li>Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system<br></li><li>Global in-game world quest<br></li><li>Localization of all in-game menus &amp; text<br></li><li>Better accessibility &amp; customization options<br></li><li>Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes<br></li><li>Mod support using Steam Workshop</li></ul><br>All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. <br><br>--AE Core TX Received--<br>--End Promotional Protocol--<br><br>--SiGnaL InTeRrUpt--<br>-tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev-', 'Indie', 'English', 'WIN', 'Afterthought LLC', 2015, 12, 01, 3.8, 23.0, 'https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/376210/header.jpg'),

Grab enemy weapons when they drop them or discover hidden treasure stashes. The game has over 120 items and weapons with different unique effects. Here are some of the items you can find:<br><br>Many items and weapons have synergies. Examples:<br><br>Drinking a Gold Diet potion allows you to eat gold, but if you find an Appetite potion as well it will boost the effect and enable you to restore a lot of health. <br><br>Voodoo Dolls allow you to hurt enemies from a distance, but if you combine it with a high-damage item like a Meteor Staff or a Bomb it can be devastating. The Celestial Smasher hammer does 200 damage per hit. If the enemy is standing over the voodoo doll he''s marked with, you can do 400 damage in one hit. For some comparison, the first level boss has 700 HP. This means you could kill it in two hits if you time your attacks properly.<br><br>There''s a status effect that boosts your stats when you have more gold. If you couple this with a Portable Foundry (turn any item into gold) and Avarice (multiply collected gold), you can become very powerful in a short amount of time.<br><br>There''s a magic potion that increases your stomping damage. Couple that with a Horse pet that triples your stomp damage, and you can kill most enemies in one stomp. Now you just need a weapon that knocks them down. There are a couple of hammers with knockdown attack, or you can use the Violent Sword that has a dashing attack that knocks many enemies down and gives you full rage after every kill. So, you can sweep the enemies, stomp at least one of them to get a kill and thus full rage for another dash. Rinse and repeat until the room is clear.<br><br>Weapons also have synergies. For example, you can combine the Enchanter''s Warbreaker hammer with the Snake Staff. Use the staff to poison all the enemies and once their health is low, kill them all with the Warbreaker and get many mana points. Mana can be used for more spells, creating potions, bombs and gold.<br><br>Another example, you can use the Rogue Sword and the Turret Staff for winning without much fighting. You can create an automated turret in the middle of the room and then use the rogue sword special ability to hide and just watch enemies getting decimated by the turret(s). With a couple of useful pets it can become a pacifist run: a bull (allows you to use the rogue sword in every battle without having to fight to build up rage) and a lizard (gain additional mana point after every battle) would allow you to only have to fight once in two battles.<br><br>Heroes with good archery skills can combine different bows and arrows, for example:<br><br>Hitting an enemy with an ice arrow would freeze it for a while, but after that passes, he will also be slow and much easier to fight against. Saving special arrows for bosses and difficult enemies is a good strategy.Pets<br><br>Adopt one of 26 different pet companions. Each has a different effect. The Penguin freezes enemies. The Ram knocks them down. The Bat attacks in the air. The Chicken shows you the path with least enemies. The Dog fetches hard to reach items and weapons. The Turtle acts as an unbeatable decoy and the Bird''s feathers improve your archery skill. If you find a Wolf to lead the pack and keep them in order, you can adopt multiple pets at the same time.Always more to explore<br>The game has permadeath. Once you die, you start a new game. A different world is created on each playthrough. The layout of the levels is different, there are different numbers and types of enemies; and different treasures and items sold in shops. There are many spells the characters can use, and archers have a wide assortment of special types of bows and arrows at their disposal. Because of this, each new game poses a new challenge. You will get a subset of weapons, items and enemies and might need to use a different strategy. Any two subsequent plays could be quite different.Various ways to complete levels<br>There''s a big boss at the end of each level. You can beat him up with a melee weapon, petrify him with Medusa Arrows, or use a magic scroll to simply skip the battle and run to the next level. <br><br>If you don''t have enough money to buy weapons from shops, you can loot it if you can beat the shop''s guard. Or you can just steal things and use a bomb or an Escape scroll to run off.<br><br>Enemies drop usable items and weapons often which you can then use against them. For example, the Necromancer drops a staff that allows you to raise undead as your servants. This includes raising some of the undead bosses as your allies. If you defeat the king, you can take his scepter, allowing you to summon an army of armored guards to help you.Monsters and bosses<br><br>The final game plays over seven areas: forest, battlements, the keep, dungeon, catacombs, desert and the frozen mountain. Each area has three or more specific bosses that randomly show up on different play-throughs.<br><br>Each area also has a different set of enemies, separated into the following factions:<br><ul><li> Goblins<br></li><li> King''s Guards<br></li><li> Thieves<br></li><li> Undead (skeletons, zombies, vampires)<br></li><li> Ice Mountain Clan<br></li><li> Desert Mercenaries<br></li><li> Animals (wild boars and dragons you can ride, bugs that drop weapon upgrades, bats, hornets, etc.)</li></ul><br>Each faction has regular units and special ones that are bigger and harder to beat.
