0,The Isle,"<strong>The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You</strong><br><br>The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. <br><br>There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors.<strong>Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer</strong><br><br>Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature.<br><br>Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise.<strong>Survival or Sandbox?</strong><br><br>The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. <br><br>However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge.<strong>A Global Community Story</strong><br><br>The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? <br><br>It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline.<strong>Future Development Goals</strong><br><br>We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include:<br><br><ul><li>Playable aquatic and aerial creatures<br></li><li>Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles<br></li><li>Two new playable factions: modern humans &amp; the indigenous<br></li><li>Evolve into advanced &quot;strain&quot; versions of certain dinosaurs<br></li><li>Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours<br></li><li>Additional world biome types such as thick jungles<br></li><li>Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system<br></li><li>Global in-game world quest<br></li><li>Localization of all in-game menus &amp; text<br></li><li>Better accessibility &amp; customization options<br></li><li>Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes<br></li><li>Mod support using Steam Workshop</li></ul><br>All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. <br><br>--AE Core TX Received--<br>--End Promotional Protocol--<br><br>--SiGnaL InTeRrUpt--<br>-tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev-",Simulation,English,WIN,Afterthought LLC,2015,12,01,3.8,23.0,https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/376210/header.jpg

Every weather scenario results in a totally different gameplay. Imagine a calm scenario making sailing difficult whereas a scenario with lots of storms and high humidity makes managing fires a real challenge.<br></li><li><strong>Latitude based</strong> weather and season - the actual weather is depending not only on the actual day of the year but also from the players actual latitude.

In some cases you need to protect your fire places from the wind.<br>   - Rain - Rain makes the used resources wet and affects stability and intensity of fire places. If fires are not placed under a roof or trees those will go out over time because of the rain.<br>   - Moisture - Reliable fires depend on the 'wet property' of added resources. All burnable resources can get wet due to rain events or when those were found in the ocean.

You will need wind, an intact sail, a rudder - and knowledge.<br></li><li><strong>Sail</strong> - Gets the raft moving. How high up sails are hoisted and how they are oriented compared to wind direction all takes into account how the wind force eventually affects your rafts moving capabilities. In heavy storms you want to take your sails in or those will be torn apart or blown away. With many different sail types available also different sailing behaviour is to be expected.<br></li><li><strong>Rudder</strong> - Steer your raft in an old fashioned way</li></ul>Raft<ul><li><strong>Modular</strong> rafts - Rafts can be modified and dismantled any time.

151,Gon' E-Choo!,"'Gon' E-Choo!' is a 3 stage, arcade-style game based on the earliest arcade platformers. You play as the otter, trying to collect paper airplanes while avoiding the crafty gator and irate bees. Collect them before they fall into the water, or it's game over! Fight back against the insects with your trusty yoyo or read The Junior Guide to Petty Zoological Facts to power up and turn the tables on the gator. Like the games it is based on, 'Gon' E-Choo!' is easy to learn, but hard to master. Casual players will be treated to tricky AI while master players can use the game's non-random patterns to speed run or reach the game's cryptic kill-screen. <br>

152,Son of a Witch,"So there we were, minding our own business in the forest. It was kinda idyllic, you know? Peace, happiness, harmony with nature, and OH YEAH, it was extra awesome because, get this, MY MOM IS A WITCH?! Well, I guess TECHnically she is, but she’s more like a Harry Potter witch than a creepy Witch Hazel type, ‘cause bless her heart, she always uses her powers for good. Anyway, she’s the best, but this is also exactly when things went wrong.<br><br>See, all of a sudden the king's guards show up, all stuffy and businesslike, and they say they’re taking my mom to the castle, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I mean, I was totally just like, “yeah right, narcs” and I snuck my way right in, but now there’s all these enemies to defeat and items to use and pets to get, and that’s only the tip of the iceberg!<br><br>Apparently, somewhere along the way, somebody else just straight up STOLE a goblin artifact, and now THEY’RE in the castle somewhere too, and the goblins are pissed so they’ve started attacking. Lucky for me, this is a co-op game as well, so I can get a friend to help me, but MAN! Goblin artifacts? Missing parents? A thief's agenda? I guess that’s just what happens when you're a... SON OF A WITCH!Key Features<br><ul><li>Explore non-linear procedurally generated dungeons<br></li><li>Fight your way through random encounters with monsters and a selection of 24 bosses<br></li><li>Find shops, treasure rooms and challenge rooms<br></li><li>Complete NPC quests to unlock playable characters<br></li><li>Get help from one of 26 cute pet companions<br></li><li>Drink random potions to power up or increase the challenge<br></li><li>Identify and use powerful magic scrolls<br></li><li>Every weapon has some unique ability or attack type<br></li><li>Every item you find has its use or special mechanics<br></li><li>Single player and up to 4 player co-op local or online<br></li><li>Three diferent play styles: melee beat'em up, magic shooter and archers sniping enemies from the distance<br></li><li>Permadeath. A new world is created every time you start the game, so it's always fresh and interesting to explore</li></ul>The Heroes<br><br>Pick one of seven heroes with different starting weapons and items, as well as Melee, Magic and Archery skill levels:<br><br><ul><li> Knight (melee combat specialist, starts with armor that reduces damage)<br></li><li> Sorceress (ranged magic attack, can create food to heal players)<br></li><li> Druid (ranged magic attack, can add poison effect to any weapon)<br></li><li> Pyromancer (shoot fireballs, immune to fire)<br></li><li> Archer (master of bow and arrows, start with additional inventory slot)<br></li><li> Skeleton Ranger (cannot eat nor drink, collects bones from fallen enemies and gets stronger)<br></li><li> Barbarian (faster rage buildup for special melee attacks, unique weapon, higher magic spell cost)</li></ul> <br>You can unlock characters by completing various quests in the game.Items, weapons and loot<br><br>Boost your strength, magic and other abilities with new weapons, potions, scrolls and items you can discover on your adventure. Grab enemy weapons when they drop them or discover hidden treasure stashes. The game has over 120 items and weapons with different unique effects. Here are some of the items you can find:<br><br>Many items and weapons have synergies. Examples:<br><br>Drinking a Gold Diet potion allows you to eat gold, but if you find an Appetite potion as well it will boost the effect and enable you to restore a lot of health. <br><br>Voodoo Dolls allow you to hurt enemies from a distance, but if you combine it with a high-damage item like a Meteor Staff or a Bomb it can be devastating. The Celestial Smasher hammer does 200 damage per hit. If the enemy is standing over the voodoo doll he's marked with, you can do 400 damage in one hit. For some comparison, the first level boss has 700 HP. This means you could kill it in two hits if you time your attacks properly.<br><br>There's a status effect that boosts your stats when you have more gold. If you couple this with a Portable Foundry (turn any item into gold) and Avarice (multiply collected gold), you can become very powerful in a short amount of time.<br><br>There's a magic potion that increases your stomping damage. Couple that with a Horse pet that triples your stomp damage, and you can kill most enemies in one stomp. Now you just need a weapon that knocks them down. There are a couple of hammers with knockdown attack, or you can use the Violent Sword that has a dashing attack that knocks many enemies down and gives you full rage after every kill. So, you can sweep the enemies, stomp at least one of them to get a kill and thus full rage for another dash. Rinse and repeat until the room is clear.<br><br>Weapons also have synergies. For example, you can combine the Enchanter's Warbreaker hammer with the Snake Staff. Use the staff to poison all the enemies and once their health is low, kill them all with the Warbreaker and get many mana points. Mana can be used for more spells, creating potions, bombs and gold.<br><br>Another example, you can use the Rogue Sword and the Turret Staff for winning without much fighting. You can create an automated turret in the middle of the room and then use the rogue sword special ability to hide and just watch enemies getting decimated by the turret(s). With a couple of useful pets it can become a pacifist run: a bull (allows you to use the rogue sword in every battle without having to fight to build up rage) and a lizard (gain additional mana point after every battle) would allow you to only have to fight once in two battles.<br><br>Heroes with good archery skills can combine different bows and arrows, for example:<br><br>Hitting an enemy with an ice arrow would freeze it for a while, but after that passes, he will also be slow and much easier to fight against. Saving special arrows for bosses and difficult enemies is a good strategy.Pets<br><br>Adopt one of 26 different pet companions. Each has a different effect. The Penguin freezes enemies. The Ram knocks them down. The Bat attacks in the air. The Chicken shows you the path with least enemies. The Dog fetches hard to reach items and weapons. The Turtle acts as an unbeatable decoy and the Bird's feathers improve your archery skill. If you find a Wolf to lead the pack and keep them in order, you can adopt multiple pets at the same time.Always more to explore<br>The game has permadeath. Once you die, you start a new game. A different world is created on each playthrough. The layout of the levels is different, there are different numbers and types of enemies; and different treasures and items sold in shops. There are many spells the characters can use, and archers have a wide assortment of special types of bows and arrows at their disposal. Because of this, each new game poses a new challenge. You will get a subset of weapons, items and enemies and might need to use a different strategy. Any two subsequent plays could be quite different.Various ways to complete levels<br>There's a big boss at the end of each level. You can beat him up with a melee weapon, petrify him with Medusa Arrows, or use a magic scroll to simply skip the battle and run to the next level. <br><br>If you don't have enough money to buy weapons from shops, you can loot it if you can beat the shop's guard. Or you can just steal things and use a bomb or an Escape scroll to run off.<br><br>Enemies drop usable items and weapons often which you can then use against them. For example, the Necromancer drops a staff that allows you to raise undead as your servants. This includes raising some of the undead bosses as your allies. If you defeat the king, you can take his scepter, allowing you to summon an army of armored guards to help you.Monsters and bosses<br><br>The final game plays over seven areas: forest, battlements, the keep, dungeon, catacombs, desert and the frozen mountain. Each area has three or more specific bosses that randomly show up on different play-throughs.<br><br>Each area also has a different set of enemies, separated into the following factions:<br><ul><li> Goblins<br></li><li> King's Guards<br></li><li> Thieves<br></li><li> Undead (skeletons, zombies, vampires)<br></li><li> Ice Mountain Clan<br></li><li> Desert Mercenaries<br></li><li> Animals (wild boars and dragons you can ride, bugs that drop weapon upgrades, bats, hornets, etc.)</li></ul><br>Each faction has regular units and special ones that are bigger and harder to beat. Like this barbarian that the shop keepers like to hire for security:<br><br>Contact e-mail<br>In case you want to contact me about the game: <a>info@bigosaur.com</a>My Mom is a Witch<br>In case you got here looking for it, the game has been named &quot;My Mom is a Witch&quot; previously.",Action,Ukrainian,LNX,Bigosaur,2018,05,16,3.5,17.2,https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/539400/header.jpg

199,Mystik Belle,"Being a student of mystical arts is hard work, doubly so if you are Belle MacFae - a freshman student at Hagmore School of Magic. The teachers and the staff are mean, her friends are few, and her grades suck. Worst of all – Belle has a tendency to be at exactly the wrong place at exactly the wrongest time. Like tonight, for example, when she stayed up late to practice her fire magic, but instead got framed for upsetting an ancient ritual. And what better way is there to punish an unlucky first-year student, than to charge her with an impossible task on the worst night of the year? Re-create the Walpurgisnacht Brew, or be expelled, and with all manner of spooks taking over the school, expulsion is starting to sound better by the minute.<br><br>Inspired by games like <strong>Slightly Magic, Puff in Dragonland, and the Dizzy series</strong>, Mystik Belle is a hybrid of a classic point-and-click adventure and a modern metroidvania.<br><br>You may experience all of the following while playing this game:<br><br><ul><li>Get hopelessly lost in the massive school building and its surrounding areas.<br></li><li>Find items and solve inventory puzzles. Or just clog up your pockets with useless junk.<br></li><li>Interact with other inhabitants of Hagmore. Learn clues, help them out, ruin their day with angry flies.<br></li><li>Fight through hallways infested by over 60 unique monster types.<br></li><li>Defeat 8 bosses.<br></li><li>Learn new magical and not-so-magical abilities.<br></li><li>Ogle at retina-burningly colorful pixel art.<br></li><li>Punch Cthulhu in the face.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li> <strong>PLEASE</strong> be advised: Mystik Belle is NOT just a metroidvania - it's a true adventure game. You will not get far without having to solve inventory puzzles or talking to people.<br></li><li> By default, the game contains some language not suitable for younger kids. A much more kid-friendly E-10 version of the dialogue is included, and can be selected from the options menu.<br></li><li> OSx version of the game doesn't support the Steam features like the overlay, achievements and trading cards. I will look for a way to get this sorted out as soon as I can. You can still get the game's internal achievements which will transfer to your Steam achievements once this is fixed.<br></li><li> I am temporarily unable to update the Mac version of the game due to changes to OSX and introduction of mandatory developer fees. I will resume Mac updates once I have the money to pay Apple their ransom.<br></li><li> Linux version of the game appears to only reliably support the Xbox 360 controller. This is a known issue of all GameMaker Studio games. More information regarding it can be found <a>here.</a></li></ul><br>",Action,Italian,LNX,Last Dimension,2015,05,22,4.1,17.2,https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/332610/header.jpg
